This HTML form takes an input and javascript validates the text submitted into the "newTask" field. 

If the field does not contain either "<" or ">", then a success message is displayed. The text submitted into the 
"newTask" field will also be made into a list element, which will then be added to the page. You can submit
as many tasks as you like and the list will continue to get larger as more list elements are added. In 
other words, you can add as many new tasks to the list as you want.

If the field contains either "<" or ">", an error message will be made visible to the user, and a new
list item will not be added.
