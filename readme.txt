The form on the index.html page, once submitted, is validated by Javascript. It validates the text submitted into 
the "newTask" field. 

If this field is validated and found to be valid, then a success message is displayed. The text submitted into the 
"newTask" field will also be made into a list element, which will then be added to the page. You can submit as 
many forms as you like and the list will continue to get larger as more list elements are added. In other words, 
you can add as many new tasks to the list as you want.

If the field contains either "<" or ">", it is invalid, and an error message will be made visible to the user. A 
new list item will not be added.
